1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,516
So how do you save time writing html

2
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:04,166
how do you become more efficient, 

3
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:05,716
how do you deliver a project 

4
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:08,333
that maybe takes 5 days in just 2 days,

5
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,950
well let's talk about that

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,033
Well, to improve your efficiency in writing HTML

7
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:18,666
usually you have to use a template engine 

8
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,400
and if you quickly Google 

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,250
we can find that there is a big list 

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,466
and among them there are like: 

11
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:27,983
pug, ejs, handlebars, nunjucks, and so many others. 

12
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:30,350
So I'll give her a handful of reasons or more 

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,733
on why you should use a template engine

14
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,733
and make sure to stay till the end 

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,566
as there'll be a bonus!

16
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,366
So let's start with: number one 

17
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:45,300
Separation. You can have the data or the model in one side 

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,416
and then the view or the presentation on another side.

19
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,333
Number two is: structure 

20
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,416
You can structure your code into components

21
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,983
which will hold a basic functionality 

22
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:57,733
with everything that is related to it: 

23
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:01,050
HTML, CSS, images, JavaScript, tests 

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,150
and so many more.

25
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,516
Number three is readable.

26
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:05,800
If you look at this code 

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,950
especially the PUG template engine for HTML

28
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,150
it's TAB based just like "Python" 

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,733
and it's easy to read. 

30
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,200
As soon as you look at it 

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,900
you'll understand its structure,

32
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,616
who's the parent, who's the child 

33
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,100
and what attributes are used inside.

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,250
Number four: collaboration

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,183
If the code has a good structure,

36
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:28,966
colaboration will come quite easily.

37
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:30,650
So if your project scales up

38
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,666
and new joiners will come

39
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,483
it'll be very easy for them 

40
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:35,900
to just look at the code,

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,883
pick it up and start developing.

42
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:41,133
Number five: most template engines 

43
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,883
are quite easy to learn.

44
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:44,000
You should spend no more

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
than a couple of hours

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,700
and sometimes up to a day 

47
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,483
but that would be all and

48
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,650
you'll quickly learn 

49
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,250
a template engine that will:

50
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,350
SAVE TIME

51
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,883
And this is my favorite feature

52
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,483
cause I always prefer

53
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:58,750
to spend the extra time

54
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,000
with my family, friends

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
or actually doing some research

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,950
or other cool projects

57
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,400
than repeating myself

58
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,450
or doing something inefficiently.

59
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,683
So with a template engine that's

60
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:10,300
well structured, easy to read

61
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,333
people can collaborate and so on

62
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,816
you can definitely save time which will make

63
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:16,983
most of the time your clients happy

64
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:20,083
and of course you can put time to better use

65
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,900
So guys I gave you a hand full of reasons or more

66
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,683
on why you should use a template engine

67
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:27,383
for writing HTML

68
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:29,166
So we've got to the bonus and

69
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,066
I'm quite excited to let you know

70
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:35,166
that this video marks the beginning of a series

71
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,633
of a step by step, from scratch tutorials,

72
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,700
in depth about how to use a template engine

73
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,100
we'll be diving into PUG, former Jade,

74
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,433
and we'll be doing some real world examples

75
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:51,033
on how to use that, so stay tuned.
