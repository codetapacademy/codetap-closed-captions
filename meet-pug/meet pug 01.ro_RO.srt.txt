1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
So what is a template engine, for HTML or anything else?

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,316
Well, let's meet PUG, which is one of the best template engines for HTML out there.

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,716
I'll press the "Start" key and R

4
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:17,350
and it'll open this command, you can just press:

5
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:22,150
the "Start" key and then type "cmd" and press "Enter"

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,033
and it'll open a command line.

7
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,966
so I'll keep those ones close as 

8
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:33,100
I have multiple partitions and I want to change into the D partition

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,450
You don't have to do this if you have only one. 

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,966
I  keep all my stuff in the "cool-stuff" folder

11
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:43,416
So you've noticed that I've double clicked the "cool-stuff"

12
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,966
In order to change on the D partition

13
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:49,583
and then go into "cool-stuff" I'll say

14
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,150
change directory "cool stuff"
cd cool-stuff

15
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,016
so we are in the same place, if you look over here:

16
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:57,900
d:\cool-stuff and d:\cool-stuff

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,783
which means: this part over here

18
00:01:00,783 --> 00:01:03,533
is the same as this part over here

19
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,950
those two are one and the same

20
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,850
and now let's continue

21
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:13,283
in here I'll say: "mkdir" which is make directory

22
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:16,650
awesome-stuff

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,566
so you notice that "awesome-stuff" has been created

24
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:22,566
I'll change into it: 
cd awesome-stuff

25
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,666
which is the same as double clicking  on it 

26
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,483
and in here I'll create another one

27
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:33,183
mkdir meet-pug

28
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:35,783
and change into it as well

29
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:39,083
cd meet-pug

30
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:44,016
so in here I want to start creating some files

31
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:48,166
I'll quickly open visual studio code by staying

32
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:50,916
code and space .

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,483
and now Visual Studio Code will be opened with the "meet-pug" directory

34
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,250
and over here

35
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,500
I will close this for a second

36
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:09,433
I'll also close this one

37
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:13,533
Actually I'll make it just smaller for you to see what happens

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,000
And I'll press CTRL + ' on Windows to open the console

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,916
Which is the same as this console, 

40
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,383
but now we have it in Visual Studio Code so we can close this one

41
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:29,650
So now, let's see! Do we have PUG?

42
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,150
Well, pug command not found, which means we don't have it.

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,283
I'll say: npm install -g which is global

44
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,733
pug-cli

45
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,850
you need to have NodeJS insalled

46
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,216
to be able to run "npm"

47
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:52,200
to install pug-cli globally to be available for all projects

48
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:57,483
now let's test if PUG is recognized

49
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:02,750
something happened or something doesn't happen

50
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,683
which means it's no longer not recognized, it is recognized

51
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,316
so let's see now, I'll create a new file here

52
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:18,450
named index.pug 

53
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,683
and in here I'll type: h1 hello

54
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:27,233
OK. So if I save it you can see that

55
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:30,266
there is a new file here and this is the content of it

56
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:34,416
now let's try: pug index.pug

57
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:40,200
so now, out of pug, index.pug

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,983
PUG converted it into a HTML file and give me a moment

59
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:50,366
So you can earily see now that

60
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:59,500
this one, h1,  has been converted into this one over here

61
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:03,800
so now I'll do something else, instead of always run ....

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,900
cause if I type this, it's not reflected in here, so I need to run again: pug index.pug

63
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,116
so in order not to be needed to run always this

64
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:21,100
I want to say: pug index.pug -w

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,850
which is watch, in watch mode

66
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:27,400
which means now it's watching index.pug

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,950
and if I make more changes and save it

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,633
you can see that those changes are reflected in here. Now you can easily

69
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,133
close this window over here, the "windows exploer", make this one bigger

70
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:43,216
and also close this one, cause I know it's watching

71
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:48,150
so whatever I do here, as soon as I save it it'll be reflected in here

72
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,183
so now about that template engine

73
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:54,716
In PUG in order to type some JavaScript you can do

74
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:58,100
minus, and then inside that minus, as

75
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,850
I press a TAB and then I say var, or let or const, whatever

76
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,183
So let's do "var" cause most people are used to this

77
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:12,716
and I"ll create a list, like people, peopleList

78
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:18,533
and in order to be a list I'll create an empty array and I'll start populating it with objects

79
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:23,933
and people have a name so I'll say: name Marian

80
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:29,483
and age 36

81
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:34,750
I'll do a comma here and I'll select those lines

82
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,433
I'm going exactly at the beginning of line 3 and using SHIFT and Down Arrow

83
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,666
I select those ones, those lines and then

84
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:49,316
with ALT + SHIFT pressed I press Down Arrow to duplicate it a few times

85
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:54,450
and now we've got more of them, that's the first one

86
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:03,033
Let's do Grace. It's easier for you to understand it in English, Gratiela is my wife

87
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:10,566
And now Grace is 31, and we've got Razvan. Razvan, how old are you?

88
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,083
25. Twenty five

89
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:17,516
And we also got Maya, my daughter, which is four

90
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:21,266
And now you'll get to understand quite quickly

91
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:24,766
what a template engine is

92
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:28,483
so if I want to output all those names

93
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:34,083
into HTML, usually I'd do something like, maybe: table

94
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:39,650
and then, OK, let's do some HTML

95
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:45,416
table, /table

96
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:49,633
let's see, if I save it ... yeah, it's there, OK ...

97
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:55,233
so then I'll do a "tr" table row

98
00:06:55,233 --> 00:07:02,033
and another tr with close

99
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:11,850
td, and then another, Marian, slash td

100
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,950
Let's duplicate. This one will be 36.

101
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:27,466
I want to go through the trouble of actually doing this so you'll see in a second, the benefits of it

102
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,916
so I'll do this as a tbody

103
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,466
and this as a thead, a tbody again, sorry

104
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:44,433
closing the tbody tag and duplicating this as ... like that

105
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:49,233
and then this is thead

106
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:55,083
and Name and age, OK.

107
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,966
so far if I am to ... 

108
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:04,300
actually let's see if there is an "open with explorer", yeah, reveal in explorer ... if I am to open this page

109
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:12,216
let me drag it here ... you can see there is a table

110
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:19,800
border equals one

111
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:26,833
so this is the table and ...

112
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:34,133
in order to add more name I'll just have to ... do more of this, multiple times, and then

113
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:40,000
It'll look like this but with the proper names.

114
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,050
this is what I would have to do in HTML

115
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,300
now lets' do it in PUG

116
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:50,066
So in PUG I would say

117
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,716
table, and than I would say: tbody

118
00:08:56,716 --> 00:09:02,350
see, I'm no longer closing the tags, I'm just using TAB to indent and 

119
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:10,900
then: tr, td Name and td, age

120
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,600
and then at the same level as tbody ... well, this is tbody actually

121
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:35,116
and this is thead ... over here, I'll do td, again td, Marian and age, 36

122
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:43,850
so what this does is: it creates this HTML automatically for us

123
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,200
ALT + Z

124
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,400
however, if I have this list over here, peopleList

125
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,650
I can iterate it and I can use either "each" or "for" to do that.

126
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:05,816
so each people ... people in peopleList

127
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:14,550
This is the same as using "for". Yeah, I'll comment it but, if you use for or each, it's the same thing.

128
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,650
each peole in peopleList ... and now I'll indent this to be under that each

129
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,916
and I'll say: people is this object, each time it iterates

130
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,333
it's this object, and this object, and this object and so on

131
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,750
and each object has a name and an age

132
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:40,866
so in here I would say: = people.name

133
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:45,616
and in here I'd say people.age

134
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:53,533
So right now, this is the template part, this here, this is the template part

135
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:58,200
or the view part where we present whatever we want

136
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,666
and this is the model or the data part

137
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:10,000
and no matter how many other ... let's say: people we have in that list

138
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,850
we always run just one time the repeating part and then PUG generates automatically for us all this.

139
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,416
So if we are to refresh this we'll see

140
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:25,100
that this code has been generated for us, let's inspect it

141
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,116
actually not inspect, let's do "view source", where is view source?

142
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:32,016
View page source

143
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:42,283
Let's also do the inspect one and in inspect we can easily see that

144
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,916
this code has been nicley generated for us

145
00:11:54,616 --> 00:12:01,016
We've got this part over here and then this has been repeated by PUG and generated

146
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:06,083
without any further intervention, we don't have to do anything

147
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:10,083
This is PUG guys! I'll see you in the next lesson.
