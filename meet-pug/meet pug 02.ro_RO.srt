00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Ultima oară ne-am întâlnit cu PUG, acum hai să aflăm cum putem să îmbunătățim procesul

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,000
 

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've created this "peopleList" over here and then we looked through it

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,633
and we are generating this HTML over here which is like one liner anyways, it's quite compressed

5
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:23,100
So in order to generate it we said: pug index.pug -w

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,000
and then this would convert index.pug in index.html and each time

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we do a change we can see that the change is propagated here, but

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's not easy for us to read, so we can further improve it

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
-w --pretty

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,300
And now it's easier for us to read it

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,100
and if we do more changes

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,133
Like over here we could say, instead of = we could say

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:56,000
td !! and then we interpolate this one into PUG

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,266
Like that and now we can see that

15
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:04,000
Every place has added two exclamation points and a space

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,866
And it's easy to read, however this is not the most efficient setup

17
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:12,000
And in order to, you know, be better coders

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
Let's find out another way and to do that I'll open again this

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,266
meet-pug and for the moment I'll close this one

20
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:24,166
Go into meet-pug and just remove it

21
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's open again the command line, so press the Start key

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,500
Type cmd

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,400
D:

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,066
cd cool-stuff

25
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,466
cd awesome-stuff

26
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:36,833
OK, let's google: pug starter

27
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,433
Just google "pug starter" and then you'll find this link

28
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:45,033
https://github.com/marianzburlea/pug-starter

29
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:48,466
Click on it. Now, if you haven't

30
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:51,433
Pressed the star button, just press the Start button over here

31
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:55,333
Let's, let me show you which one is it. Just to make sure ... this one

32
00:01:55,333 --> 00:02:00,366
There is a Star button. If you see Unstar it means you have already added it to your favourites

33
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:04,600
If not press that Star button which is located under here

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,033
And when you do that, then you can find it under "Your stars"

35
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:12,866
That's how I favourite all the projects that I'm interested in

36
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,866
And that's how you'll quickly find this one, cause some of them

37
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,833
See, the have like weird names: abs-studio-amf-encoder

38
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,200
You can't really remember this all the time, so

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,766
It's easier if you add it to your favourites by pressing the Star button

40
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:32,700
Anyway, the point is: we go on pug-starter, click the clone button and then click this one

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,266
This button, click it to copy it to the clipboard

42
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,566
And then over here we just say:

43
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:44,000
Git clone and I'll press "Shift + Insert" to paste it and then I'll name it

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,666
meet-pug, so

45
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,266
git space clone space paste the URL or type

46
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:56,933
https://github.com/marianzburlea/pug-starter.git

47
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:59,333
Space meet-pug

48
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:04,766
Which will clone the project into a folder named: meet-pug

49
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:07,200
Now: cd meet-pug

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:16,000
Will type: npm which is node package manager

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,300
npm and i for install, OK? So "i" or "install" 

52
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,500
is the same thing, just type: npm i

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,000


54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000


55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,100


56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,300
So once this is done, let's open

57
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,000
This folder under Visual Studio Code

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,200
So: code .

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,666
And into this "src" we can see that we have an index.pug file

60
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,300
With some initial setup

61
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll press CTRL + ' to open the command line under Windows

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I'll type: npm start

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,566


64
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:16,700
Now let's add this to the left side

65
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,666


66
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:24,000
OK, so now over here if we type something and

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,733
Save it we can see that it auto-refreshes

68
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:31,366
And on top of that later on we can also see that later on this project offers

69
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:35,300
Options to style it, and not just style it, deploy it to GitHub and so on

70
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,000
However we are more interested in PUG so

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,533
Let catch up in the next lesson where we'll start to talk about

72
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,166
PUG attributes or attributes in PUG. Happy Hacking!
