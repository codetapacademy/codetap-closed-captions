1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,233
More attributes in PUG

2
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:04,600


3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,866
So last time we've talked about attributes and multiline attributes. Now let's talk about

4
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:14,800
quoted attributes and attributes interpolation

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,333
Let's see if we can close everything here

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,766
and let's make a new file:

7
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:29,233
quoted-attributes.pug

8
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:35,300
And that means that we also have "quoted-attributes.html". Let's drag it over here.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,733
And quoted attributes, so let's see, let's see.

10
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:46,600
Maybe we have a div and if anybody has played with Angular so far

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,400
In angular we can have, let's see ... whatever

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,000
class="nice"

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And then we can have a (click) event

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And this would be calling "myFunction()"

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,633
And let me also quickly open the command line, over here, and if we save it

16
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:19,000
We can see that we get an error. In order to get rid of that error

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,933
We can do a comma over there. If we save it we can see that over here

18
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:28,233
No more errors, everything looks fine and dandy, or ...

19
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:33,000
We can omit that comma. Actually let's duplicate this line

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,100
Do two pipes and then omit this comma

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,466
if we save it, we get back that error. However if we select this

22
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:49,066
And do single quotes around it we can see that

23
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:56,000
We get the same output. So this is quoted attributes.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now let's do one more: attribute interpolation

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
attribute-interpolation.pug

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000


27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's drag it over here. So this attribute interpolation

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,366
Which means, ... let's open a JavaScript and say: 

29
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:36,400
- var myUrl = 'http://codetap.io/cv'

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,566
This is where you can download your free template resume

31
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:46,000
It's actually my personal one. This is the one that I use when I go to interviews

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, with that said let's do now an "a" tag with a "href"

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,400
href=myUrl

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,500
So if we save it, we can see that it generated this, so I'll

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Add a label: click to download your free CV template

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now we've generated this HTML over here.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's just make less text. Cool

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,533
So now we say again:

39
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:37,133
- var myUrl ... I'm not sure if it'll conflict, let's just try it, and this will be: contact.html

40
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:46,100
Then another "a" tag with href=myUrl and "Contact me"

41
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,800
Let's see now. We've got two of them side by side and I think we need

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,600
Here a pipe, or two. Let's see if we put two pipes like that. Does it work?

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,833
Or .. no, it just makes another pipe.

44
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:08,866
This was attribute interpolation and quoted attributes in PUG

45
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:11,266
Let's see each other in the next lesson!
