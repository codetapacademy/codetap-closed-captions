1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,233
More attributes in PUG

2
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:04,600


3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,866
So last time we've talked about attributes and multiline attributes. Now let's talk about

4
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:14,800
quoted attributes and attributes interpolation

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,333
Let's see if we can close everything here

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,766
and let's make a new file:

7
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:29,233
quoted-attributes.pug

8
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:35,300
And that means that we also have "quoted-attributes.html". Let's drag it over here.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,733
And quoted attributes, so let's see, let's see.

10
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:46,600
Maybe we have a div and if anybody has played with Angular so far

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,400
In angular we can have, let's see ... whatever

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,000
class="nice"

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And then we can have a (click) event

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And this would be calling "myFunction()"

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000


16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000


17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000


18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000


19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000


20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000


21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000


22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000


23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000


24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000


25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000


26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000


27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000


28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000


29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000


30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000


31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000


32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000


33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000


34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000


35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000


36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000


37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000


38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000


39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000


40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000


41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000


42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000


43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000


44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000


45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000


46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000


47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000


48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000


49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000


50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000


51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000


52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000


53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000


54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000


55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000


56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000


57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000


58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000


59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000


60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,266
