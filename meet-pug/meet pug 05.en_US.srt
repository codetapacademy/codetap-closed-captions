00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome back to "Meet Pug"

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,733


3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:10,600
We've done so many so lessons so far, however I want you to have access

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,800
To the code that I'm writing. So for that I'm not going to do

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,733
Pug right now, we're just going to quickly make this project available online. So follow me.

6
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:27,000
So over here I'll open the console and

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,266
Actually I'll open a new one over here, a new terminal and if I say:

8
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:39,333
git remote -v 

9
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:43,733
It shows that it's still pointing to marianzburlea/pug-starter, so

10
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:48,300
Let's assume you want this to be your project, so 

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll quickly open a new window over here

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I will go on GitHub

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And github.com/codatepio

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,700
So let's assume that "codetapio" will be your username, not mine, which is marianzburlea

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,000
Over here I'll create a new project

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,233
meet-pug

17
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:19,400
Create repository. Now I want to point to: codetapio/meet-pug

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,866
Not to marianzburlea/pug-starter so all I have to do is:

19
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:27,833
Remove the connection to git

20
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:31,433
Anyway. I also want to remove history so I'll just say:

21
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:36,000
rm -rf which is remove recursive with force

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,500
This is remove, this is recursive and this is with force

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,633


24
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:44,966
And I'll remove the ".git" folder

25
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,900
git status

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,766
Now git no longer knows anything about it

27
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:52,966
"git init" will reinitialise git

28
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,966
"git add ." everything and

29
00:01:55,966 --> 00:02:04,833
git commit -m "meet pug is quite awesome"

30
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,766


31
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:12,000
And now all I have to do is to copy those two lines

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
or those two lines. They are one and the same.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,333
Paste them over here, press "Enter", give it a second

34
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:25,166
And now if I refresh the page

35
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,000
You can see that we got 

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,033


37
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:36,333
All of our files that we've written so far accessible and

38
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:40,000
On the web, on GitHub, open sourced

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500


40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,666
And I'll continue to make commits and you can find all those files on:

41
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,100
https://github.com/codetapio/meet-pug

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,666
So see you in the next lesson!
