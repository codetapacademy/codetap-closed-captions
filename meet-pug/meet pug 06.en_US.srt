1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,633
So let's play some more with attributes in PUG

2
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:05,633


3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:09,400
Last time we've played with quoted attributes and attributes interpolation

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,366
Actually over here, let's quickly change this one, like that. And we can also do:

5
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:19,866
+ '.html' so this is like JavaScript

6
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:23,566
OK, let's save it. We can see that it's the same thing.

7
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,466
Especially if you do like: ?a=2

8
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:30,600
We can see that the change gets propagate here

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,100
That was another thing about attribute interpolation.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:41,233
So now let's close some of those files and create a new file

11
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:48,000
unescaped.pug

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000


13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,900
That's unescaped.pug and unescaped.html, split

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,733
And let's leave it like that for a second.

15
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:08,000
OK, so let's do another div

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,966
And inside it let's make: 

17
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:24,000
code="<b>name</b>"

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,566
And, actually, let's make it horizontal, it's easier for you to see.

19
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:36,000
We can see that this one gets converted into this one, however this is lesser than sign

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is the lesser than sign

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,866
And then it's "b" and it's the greater than sign, undo ...

22
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:51,200
So it's not exactly what we wanted. So if we want to "unescape" it.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's put some pipes, right? We want to "unescape" it, 

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We want to put an exclamation "!" before that equal "="

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is escaped, this is unescaped

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now let's see some other things

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's play with the boolean ones

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,633
boolean.pug

29
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:20,000
Ok, let's move boolean.pug here, and boolean.html here

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now let's do an "input" tag and inside here we'll type: type="text"

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,900
And then we'll do "checked"

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,833
Save it, we can see that this is the output of that

33
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:46,100
Let's do a couple of pipes and then: input(type="radio")

34
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,100
And we can say: checked=true

35
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,933
So, again, checked, checked

36
00:02:53,933 --> 00:03:00,000
And then let's duplicate this one and do checked=false

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, in this case checked is omitted

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,366
However if we are to specify: doctype html

39
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:12,633
html

40
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:16,466
It knows not to mirror the checked attribute

41
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:19,300
Which means it just gonna output this one

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,600
If we want to actually output the "checked" one,

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's duplicate this and do: true

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,333
If we save it we can see, checked here

45
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:36,000
And we can say: if true, if this is true

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,933
Which it is right now

47
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:42,700
We can type 'checked'

48
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,733
And now we've got checked="checked"

49
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:52,000
And this is the unescaped and the boolean attributes in PUG

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Happy Hacking!
