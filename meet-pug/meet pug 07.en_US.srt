1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,366
OK, so last time we've played with the unescaped and the boolean attribute in PUG. Let's play some more.

2
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,300


3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:16,266
Let's close some of those files, not all of them and in here, into attributes I'll create

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,266
style.pug

5
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:24,000
And I'll also drag style over here, come on.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Close this and close this one and into style

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,966
If you have already played with React you might know about

8
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:35,666
this one otherwise let's do an "a" tag

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:40,000
With a style and in here

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's pass an object and do: color

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
With the value of red

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And we can see, the style receives this one, over here

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,700
Let's also do background

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,566
And color, background-colour: blue

15
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:12,000
However this one should not work and if we open the console we can see that there is an error over there

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,300
That's because we need to cameCase

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,366
So backgroundColor, like that. If we save it we can see

18
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:24,266
Color red and background ... actually we don't need to camelCase

19
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:28,000
Maybe we need to put it in a string. Let's put it in a string

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not like React, it's not React

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,166
Now we've got color: red and background-colour: blue

22
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:39,200
So that the style one. Now let's create another one

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,066
The class attribute.

24
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:46,566


25
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:49,500
class.pug

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,566
And open the class.pug, close that style

27
00:01:54,566 --> 00:02:00,000
So let's create a couple of arrays over here and I'll do:

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,600
class, var class1List = [] and this might sound familiar to you from

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:20,000
Bootstrap, btn and btn-primary

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll use some examples that you might be already used to

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's do: var class2List = []

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
btn-small

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And now let's do a div(class=class1List)

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If we save it we can see that this array

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,666
Has been joined into values using space

36
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:04,766
So whatever values you'll be inputting in here, maybe like that:

37
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:08,000
It will be joined. Let's do another one

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Another div, a couple of pipes

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
For whitespace control, and this would be the second one

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,666
Ok, so you can see that I also converts it into just a single value over there

41
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:29,466
However, there is another thing, we can repeat this attribute class

42
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:32,833
And pass it class1List

43
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:40,000
Now, if we look into it, it joined, it concatenated 

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,433
The two arrays into one and then outputted all values with spaces between them

45
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,500


46
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,000
Now lets do some more classes, let's do some more classes. New file

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
literal-class.pug

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Move the pug on top, close that file

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, no. we want this to be

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
... copy the name of it

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And delete that file

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,733
And we want to create a new file inside the "attributes" not in the "tmp"

53
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:32,000
So literal-class.pug and then open

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
literal-class.html , split it

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Horizontally and we are almost there

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,700
Ok so literal class means we can do an "a" tag with

57
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,000
.btn as a class and then

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Click me

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,733
Go away, go away!

60
00:04:53,733 --> 00:05:00,000
So this is like that. You can also do another dot, let's do some pipes

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,733
And .btn.btn-small

62
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:11,300
So we can see that the second one is like that

63
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,000
And we can also do a div, pipe pipe, div

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,666
.this-is-a-class

65
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:28,266
However, if you want to omit the div tag which is in Pug the default one

66
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:32,333
You can just do the class like in CSS and it will convert 

67
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:37,300
By default into this div, so the default tag in

68
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,433
Literal class in pug is div

69
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:45,233
You can type the div or you can optionally omit it

70
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,533
So, happy hacking!
